# [UNITY] Background Music Shuffler

## Description

This is a small script I wrote for one of the games I've been working on lately in Unity, and I thought it might be useful to share it :D

## Instructions

1. Add the script to a Game Object
2. Add your tracks to the Tracks List **_(leave the Shuffle Container empty)_**
3. Drag and drop your Audio Source onto the Audio Source field of the script
4. Enjoy!

## Footer

The script may lack specific functionalities (for example maybe you don't want to shuffle the music), but feel free to modify it however you want. I think it's better to start from here than from 0 :D

For now the script has the following:

- Fade IN/OUT when going from one track to another
- Fade duration (maybe you want the fade to be more sudden than to take a lot of time)
- MAX Volume slider
